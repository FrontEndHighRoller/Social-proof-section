## 👀 Why This Project Stands Out

- Built from a real-world **Frontend Mentor challenge**
- Complex layout requiring careful **HTML structure planning**
- Fully responsive across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- Pixel-focused styling using custom CSS
- Demonstrates persistence and problem-solving in UI layout design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5** – Semantic and well-structured markup  
- **CSS3** – Flexbox, media queries, custom properties (CSS variables)  
- **Google Fonts** – League Spartan typography  
- **Frontend Mentor Design Assets**

---

## ✨ Features

- Star rating review cards with visual hierarchy  
- Customer testimonial cards with staggered layout  
- Mobile-first design approach  
- Desktop layout with aligned and offset sections  
- Clean colour system using CSS variables  
- Fully responsive without JavaScript  

---

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to **break down complex UI designs** into manageable components  
- Structuring HTML for **scalable and responsive layouts**
- Using **Flexbox** for alignment and spacing
- Writing **clean CSS architecture** with reusable classes
- Applying **media queries** for large-screen layouts
- Translating a design mockup into a pixel-accurate implementation

> 📌 This challenge was difficult at first—especially deciding how to structure the layout—but completing it helped me significantly improve my understanding of responsive design and layout composition.
